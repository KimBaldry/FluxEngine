FluxEngine
==========

open source atmosphere-ocean gas flux data processing tools.

The FluxEngine source code will be available for download in the near future.

We have written and submitted a journal article describing the toolbox, its design and validation along with some examaple applications and results. We will release the FluxEngine code under an open-source license once the journal article review process has reached a conclusion.
