    "# Introduction to Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "This workshop uses Jupyter notebooks. This is a convenient way to combined text and images with code. You'll find Python code examples embedded in the text tutorial. You can run these examples by clicking the run (play) button. The code can also be edited and ran again so that you can see the consequences of changes to the code. To start again from the beginning you can reset the notebook by choosing `Kernel` from the top menu, then `Restart & clear output`."

    "# Verifying FluxEngine has been installed correctly\n",
    "It is important to verify that FluxEngine, and its dependencies, have been installed correctly. This will prevent problems arising later, and gives us confidence that the flux calculation is being performed correctly by running a known scenario and comparing it to previously published data. This is all handled automatically using a verification script. If you have already ran the verification script when you first installed FluxEngine you do not have to do this again. If you haven't already, then run the verification script below. It will take a few minutes to run, but you can continue with the rest of the tutorial while you wait, remembering to check back to make sure you got a message saying \"Validation successful! All values are within threshold limits\" when it has finished running."

    "Lets have a look at the configuration file used to run the above verification. FluxEngine uses plain text configuration files to specify input data and selection various options to change how the flux calculation is performed. Use a text editor such as Notepad++ to open `FluxEngine/configs/socatv4_sst_salinity_gradients-N00.conf.`\n",

    "<b>Note - Opening config files: </b> Configuration files are in plain text format and can be opened in software such as Notepad, Notepad++ or TextEdit. You should not use Microsoft Word or other word processing software to edit configuration files because they can add invisible formatting characters to files which can prevent the FluxEngine interpretting the file correctly. On some older Windows systems configuration files may display all on one line. The easiest way to avoid this is by installing Notepad++ (a free lightweight text editor), and using this to edit configuration files.\n",

    "Configuration files contain a list of options/setting names and values following the format of `option = value`. Any text preceeded by a `#` symbol is a comment, and usually provides information about what a particular setting, or group of settings do. Near the top of the configuration file you just opened, you will see that the `flux_calc` option is assigned the value `rapid`. This tells FluxEngine to use temperature gradients when calculating the flux (in contrast to the 'bulk' equation, which used only one temperature). Next there are a set of options for defining how to handle the skin layer, including whether to derive the skin (or foundation) layer SST from the foundation (or skin) SST, as well as differences in temperature and salinity for the skin layer. Then the configuration file defines some metadata about the input datasets, selects a gas transfer velocity parameterisation (k) and specifies an output directory. Information on all of these options are available in [the instructions](https://github.com/oceanflux-ghg/FluxEngine/blob/master/FluxEngineV3_instructions.pdf) (see section 7.2).\n",
